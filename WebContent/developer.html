									<h3><a href="#">Our Project</a></h3>

								<p>
									We have designed a fully responsive timetable program that allows you to view lecture's and other mandatory events that relate to your course of study. 
									It also incorporates functionality that allows you add personal events to the calendar and organise meeting's with lecturer's or with other groups of people in your course.

										<h3>Project Justification</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										The current system in place in terms of arranging meetings is one whereby blank timetables are 
										handed out to students and they are asked to fill them in. This a manually approach to 
										determining free time slots with obvious flaws in that it is impractical and extremely time 
										consuming. 

									</p>
									<p>We propose to implement a system that will overcome the current model.We will examine the functional
									requirements and prioritize according to importance. Of key importance here is to keep in mind that
									certain constraints may inhibit progress and must be dealt with in a compromising way.
</p>

										<h3>Program Features</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										With this system we have created a feature whereby users can organise and schedule meetings based on available time slots. As you can see from the above User Interface we have created a simple to use design based on a tile effect layout.
										Where possible the team has tried to eliminate user error by prompting input using pre-populated input fields and select options.
										This should ensure ease of use. Additional features include the use of a notifications page whereby users can view requested meetings from other students or lecturers. 	
										We have also included an interactive timetable feature that permits personal events to be stored in a centralised database.
